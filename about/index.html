        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>It’s January 2021. The UK has just entered its 3rd lockdown and all theatres remain closed. For actors Sam
            and Mark, the future looks bleak. As the pandemic drags on Mark who lives alone is increasingly socially
            isolated, while Sam is panicking about how he is going to support his family. They channel their midlife
            frustrations by immersing their avatars in the horrifically violent yet beautifully rendered virtual world
            of Grand Theft Auto Online. They steal cars and shoot strangers, but also find moments of calm reflection
            walking through meadows of wildflowers. In one gaming session they stumble across a theatre and have an
            idea. Why not stage Hamlet inside the game? Well, there are several reasons why not, chiefly that most
            people in the game are intent on murderous destruction, not polite appreciation of a theatrical production.
            But wasn’t theatre just as dangerous and rowdy a business in Shakespeare’s time, and isn’t Hamlet, a play
            about revenge the perfect choice for this place? </p>

        <p>This documentary is shot entirely inside the world of Grand Theft Auto. It's ground-breaking and necessary -
            especially at a time when more and more of our lives (even a cultural artefact as ancient as live theatre)
            move online. The documentary asks what is this space? How do we use it now and what else is possible inside
            it? Can we transport this ancient story inside a brand new one? And will it still make sense? The cinematic
            potential of Los Santos is immediately apparent, with its glittering, mind-blowingly detailed cityscape and
            surrounding countryside, the ray-traced rendering of light, ever-changing weather systems and intricate
            sound design. By using the in-game phone camera we were able to get intimate close ups and cinematic pans
            across landscapes - enabling a more cinematic visual language and moments of pathos, emotion and lyricism to
            exist within the chaos and violence of this undiscovered country.</p>
